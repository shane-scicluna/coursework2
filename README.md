# Read-me
A program that attempts to classify two sets of data in a .csv format. Euclidean distance "between" the vectors is found and then using a nearest neighbour algorithm, the "closest" vector is found. The final value is compared and if equal, then the classification was correct. The results are printed out as a percentage.


The size and amount of values the program handles can be changed by changing the "ROW" and "COL" variables.
